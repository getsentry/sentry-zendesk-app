**NOTE: THIS VERSION OF THE APP USES THE OLD ZENDESK APP INTERFACE, WHICH HAS BEEN DEPRECATED. THIS VERSION OF THE APP IS THEREFORE ALSO DEPRECATED. YOU CAN FIND THE NEW VERSION AT https://github.com/getsentry/getsentry-zendesk-v2.**

## Testing the app locally

The app is deployed by the admin but can be tested locally before it's deployed.

### 1. Setting up the Zendesk tools

Use Zendesk tools to serve the local app in a way that the Zendesk interface can access. There's detailed instructions [here](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203691256) on how to use their tools.

First, install the tools:

    $ sudo gem install zendesk_apps_tools

If you get compilation errors on OS X, you may need to run this first (Choose install, you only need the command line tools, not all of Xcode):

    $ xcode-select --install

Once installed, run the local development environment using

    $ zat server

### 2. Telling Zendesk to use local apps

Add ```?zat=true``` to any Zendesk URL. For example:

    https://sentry.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/701?zat=true

When the page loads, the right corner of the URL bar will have a little shield telling you it prevented unsafe scripts from loading. Press the ```Load Unsafe Scripts``` button and the page will reload again with your app.

### 3. Packaging and deploying

Covered more [here](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203691296-Building-your-first-Zendesk-app-Part-5-Installing-the-app-in-your-Zendesk)

Run

    $ zat package

This will spit out a zip file. You'll upload the app as an admin: Admin -> Apps -> Manage -> Upload App.
